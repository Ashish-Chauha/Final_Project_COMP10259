        <p class="center-paragraph"><i>Clownfish, or anemonefish, are a group of tropical reef fishes found in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean, Red Sea and western Pacific Ocean. There are 30 recognized species of clownfish, all but one of which belong to the genus Amphiprion. The only species in the genus Premnas, the maroon clownfish, is distinguished from all other clownfish by the presence of a spine on its cheek.

            The most well-know species of clownfish, thanks to the popular film Finding Nemo, is the ocellaris clownfish. Although the name clownfish reflects the bright orange pigmentation and white stripes of this and other species, not all species look the same. Clownfish range from being pale pink though to dark brown and have varying numbers of white or even golden stripes.</i>

            <p class="center-paragraph"><i>Clownfish live at the bottom of shallow seas at depths of 10-50 feet (3-15 m) in sheltered rocky or coral reefs. Their alternative name, anemonefish, reflects the symbiotic relationship these fish form with sea anemones. Clownfish are omnivores and eat a variety of prey items, but feed primarily on zooplankton including copepods, isopods and tunicate larvae. In addition to this, clownfish also eat algae, as well as the uneaten prey items and dead tentacles of their host anemones.

                Clownfish associate in small groups consisting of a single, monogamous breeding pair and a few non-breeding juvenile males. A strict dominance hierarchy exists in each group, whereby the female is always the largest, followed by the breeding male. The smaller non-breeding males decrease in size further down the hierarchy..</i>

        <p class="center-paragraph">Common Clownfish play a significant role in maintaining the health of their sea anemone hosts. They help clean the anemones and, in return, receive protection from predators. Their presence is crucial for the balance of the reef ecosystem.
        By promoting biodiversity, clownfish contribute to the overall health of coral reef systems, making them essential for marine ecosystems.</p>

        <h2 style="margin: 0px 320px;" ><p style="color: green;">Threats</h2>
        <p class="center-paragraph">Common Clownfish face threats from habitat loss, climate change, and pollution. The aquarium trade also poses a risk, as they are popular pets. Conservation efforts are needed to protect their populations and habitats.</p><p></p>

        <p class="center-paragraph">Climate change causes coral bleaching, which directly impacts the anemones that clownfish rely on for shelter and food.</p>

        <h2>What WWF is Doing</h2><p></p>
        <p class="center-paragraph">The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is working to protect Common Clownfish by promoting sustainable fishing practices and establishing marine protected areas. They also conduct research to better understand the needs of these fish and their habitats.</p>
        <p class="center-paragraph">WWF collaborates with local communities to implement conservation initiatives that benefit both wildlife and the people who rely on healthy marine ecosystems.</p>

    <section id="how-you-can-help" class="topic-section">
        <h2>How You Can Help</h2><p></p>
        <p class="center-paragraph">You can help protect Common Clownfish by supporting conservation organizations, reducing your use of plastic, and being mindful of your seafood choices. Educating others about the importance of coral reefs and the species that inhabit them can also make a difference.</p>
        <p class="center-paragraph">Participate in local beach clean-ups and advocate for marine protection policies in your community to help ensure the survival of clownfish and other marine species.</p>
